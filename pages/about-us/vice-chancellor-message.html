              <p>I extend a warm welcome to all students joining Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University. The hostel life at
                SMVDU is designed to provide you with a nurturing environment that complements your academic journey.
                Our hostels are not just places of residence; they are communities where lifelong friendships are
                forged, leadership skills are developed, and personal growth is encouraged.</p>

              <p>At SMVDU, we believe that a well-rounded education extends beyond the classroom. Our hostel facilities
                are equipped with modern amenities to ensure your comfort and well-being. The Warden's Council,
                comprising dedicated faculty members, works tirelessly to maintain a harmonious and disciplined
                atmosphere that fosters both personal and academic excellence.</p>

              <p>I emphasize the importance of discipline, mutual respect, and adherence to hostel rules and
                regulations. These guidelines are essential for creating a safe and conducive living environment for all
                residents. Every student is expected to contribute positively to the hostel community and uphold the
                values of our university.</p>

              <p>Ragging is strictly prohibited at SMVDU. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of
                ragging, whether on campus or off-campus. If you encounter any such incident, please report it
                immediately to your warden, any faculty member, or the university administration. Your safety and
                well-being are our top priorities.</p>

              <p>I encourage all students to actively participate in hostel activities, maintain regular communication
                with their wardens, and make the most of their time at SMVDU. The hostel experience is an integral part
                of your university journey, and I hope it will be memorable and enriching.</p>

              <p>I wish you all a successful and fulfilling academic journey at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University. May
                your stay in our hostels be comfortable, productive, and contribute significantly to your overall
                development.</p>
